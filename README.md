REXX Practice Repository

Welcome to my REXX Practice repository.
This space documents my learning process as I study and practice REXX programming on the IBM Mainframe (z/OS).
Here, I store small scripts, exercises, and code samples that help me build skills step by step.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

Practice REXX syntax and logic

Understand how REXX interacts with TSO/ISPF

Develop problem-solving skills for mainframe automation

Track my progress as I continue learning

📂 What You Will Find

Beginner REXX scripts

Logic exercises (loops, arrays, parsing, conditions)

Small utilities created during practice

Notes and comments added as I learn new concepts

Each script may include simple examples such as:

Reading and displaying user input

Working with arrays and DO loops

Parsing strings and files

Creating small tools for TSO or ISPF

🚀 Learning Goals

Improve my understanding of REXX on z/OS

Learn how to write clean and readable code

Practice debugging and testing

Build confidence using mainframe tools and utilities

📝 Notes

This repository is a work in progress.
As I learn more, I will keep adding new scripts and updating older ones to show my improvement.
